.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility searches for manuals named or described with
.Ar term
in manual page databases generated by
.Xr mandocdb 8 .
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl M Ar manpath
Use the colon-separated path instead of the default list of paths
searched for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.

databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
.It Fl S Ar arch
Search only for a particular architecture.
.It Fl s Ar cat

See
.Xr man 1

.Pp
By default,
.Nm
searches for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases in the default paths stipulated by
.Xr man 1 .
Results are sorted by manual title, with output formatted as

.Pp
Where
.Qq title
is the manual's title (note multiple manual names may exist for one
title),
.Qq sec
is the manual section, and
.Qq description
is the manual's short description.
If an architecture is specified for the manual, it is displayed as
.Pp
.D1 title(cat/arch) \- description
.Pp
Resulting manuals may be accessed as
.Pp
.Dl $ man \-s sec title
.Pp
If an architecture is specified in the output, use
.Pp
.Dl $ man \-s sec \-S arch title
.Pp
.Nm
is identical to running
