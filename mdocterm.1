.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats a BSD 
.Dq mdoc 
manual page for display on the terminal.  The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.\" ITEM
.It Fl v
Print verbose parsing output.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl v
Print version and exit.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl f Ns Ar option...
Override default compiler behaviour.  See 
.Sx Compiler Options
for details.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl O Ns Ar option...
Front-end options.  See
.Sx Front-end Options
for details.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Print warning messages.  May be set to 
.Fl W Ns Ar all
for all warnings, 
.Ar compat
for groff/troff-compatibility warnings, or
.Ar syntax
for syntax warnings.  If
.Fl W Ns Ar error 
is specified, warnings are considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple 
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.\" ITEM
.It Ar infile
Read input from
.Ar infile ,
which may be 
.Dq \-
for stdin.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
If
.Xr nroff 1
arguments are supplied on the command line
.Pq Fl himnorT ,
these are ignored unless 
.Xr nroff 1
is invoked on parse failure.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is a formatting front-end for
.Xr mdoc 3 ,
which parses the 
.Dq mdoc
input, documented at
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr mdoc.samples 7 ,
into an abstract syntax tree.  
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
By default, 
.Nm 
reads from stdin and prints nroff 
.Qq backspace
terminal-encoded output to stdout, at this time to a fixed column with
of 78 characters.  If
.Ar infile
can't be parsed (isn't valid mdoc, doesn't contain valid syntax, etc.),
.Xr nroff 1
is invoked.  If no 
.Xr nroff 1
command-line argumnets aren't provided,
.Fl m Ar Ns andoc
is implied.
.\" PARAGRAPH

.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Front-end Options
The default behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl O
flag.  The available options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.It Fl O Ns Ar nopunt
Don't punt to 
.Xr nroff 1
if 
.Ar infile
may not be parsed.
.El
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Compiler Options
Default compiler behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl f
flag.  The available options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope
When rewinding the scope of a block macro, forces the compiler to ignore
scope violations.  This can seriously mangle the resulting tree.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-escape
Ignore invalid escape sequences.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-macro
Ignore unknown macros at the start of input lines.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
As with the
.Fl W
flag, multiple
.Fl f
and
.Fl O
options may be grouped and delimited with a comma.  Using
.Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope,ign-escape ,
for example, will try to ignore scope and character-escape errors.
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Character Escapes
The
.Nm
utility correctly renders all 
.Sx Special Characters
in
.Xr mdoc 7
in 7-bit ASCII.
.Pp
In the general sense, 
.Nm
will make a 
.Pq best-effort
to render complex characters; however, if a manual is using considerable
special characters, some meaning may be lost in translation.

The \-literal and \-unfilled
