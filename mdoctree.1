.Op Fl v
.Op Fl W Ns Ar err...
.Op Ar infile
.\" SECTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility parses a BSD 
.Dq mdoc 
manual pages and prints its syntax tree.  It's commonly used to see the
syntax tree of a document when building new 
.Xr mdoc 3
utilities.  The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "\-Werr... "
.\" ITEM
.It Fl v
Print verbose parsing output.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Print warning messages.  May be set to 
.Fl W Ns Ar all
for all warnings, 
.Ar compat
for groff/troff-compatibility warnings, or
.Ar syntax
for syntax warnings.  If
.Fl W Ns Ar error 
is specified, warnings are considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple 
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.\" ITEM
.It Ar infile
Read input from
.Ar infile ,
which may be 
.Dq \-
for stdin.

.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is a formatting front-end for
.Xr mdoc 3 ,
which parses the 
.Dq mdoc
input, documented at
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr mdoc.samples 7 ,
into an abstract syntax tree.
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads from stdin and prints the syntax tree to stdout.
