- the roff parser doesn't tolerate additional characters between
  a macro and the \} terminating a conditional block, e.g.
  .if n \{
  .br \}

- .BI "string string " word punct in gettext(3)
  add bogus line breaks (rep by naddy@)
  committed; currently working on IP and TP?
  and what about B and I?

************************************************************************
* missing features
************************************************************************

- explicit blocks with missing end macro should be implicitely closed
  at the end of the enclosing block, e.g. .Bl It (El) Sh

- fix bad block nesting involving multiple identical explicit blocks
  see the OpenBSD mdoc_macro.c 1.47 commit message

- .Bl -column .Xo support is missing
  ultimate goal:
  restore .Xr and .Dv to
  lib/libc/compat-43/sigvec.3
  lib/libc/gen/signal.3
  lib/libc/sys/sigaction.2

- edge case: decide how to deal with blk_full bad nesting, e.g.
  .Sh .Nm .Bk .Nm .Ek .Sh found by jmc@ in ssh-keygen(1)

- auto-Bk in the SYNOPSIS
  patch from kristaps@  Fri, 16 Jul 2010 14:51:24 +0200
  to be revisited after OpenBSD 4.8 tree unlock

- implement \\
  in plain text, identical to \e
  as a macro argument, identical to \ i.e. escaping the next character
  We do not have macro definitions yet; if we implement them,
  \\ must behave in a macro def like in a macro argument,
  and when using the macro, it must expand yet again.

- implement basic non-parametric .de to support e.g. sox(1)
  reported by naddy@ Sat, 16 Oct 2010 23:51:57 +0200
  *** sox(1) still doesn't work, tbl(1) errors need investigation

- clean up escape sequence handling, creating three classes:
  (1) fully implemented, or parsed and ignored without loss of content
  (2) unimplemented, potentially causing loss of content
      or serious mangling of formatting (e.g. \n) -> ERROR
      see textproc/mgdiff(1) for nice examples
  (3) undefined, just output the character -> perhaps WARNING

- port OpenBSD tbl integration bsd.lv, probably cleaning it up

- look at pages generated from reStructeredText, e.g. devel/mercurial hg(1)
  These are a weird mixture of man(7) and custom autogenerated low-level
  roff stuff.  Figure out to what extent we can cope.

- implement blank `Bl -column', such as
  .Bl -column
  .It foo Ta bar
  .El

- explicitly disallow nested `Bl -column', which would clobber internal
  flags defined for struct mdoc_macro

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, punctuation is handled like normal
  text, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Fl x . Ta ...' should give "-x -."

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, TERMP_IGNDELIM handling by `Pf'
  is not safe, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Pf a b .' gives "ab."
  but should give "ab ."

- set a meaningful default if no `Bl' list type is assigned

- have a blank `It' head for `Bl -tag' not puke

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

- xloadimage(1) wants .ti (temporary indent), rep by naddy@

- bashbug(1) complains "line scope broken" after
  .SM
  .B something
  should either just work or be a warning

* formatting issues: ugly output
************************************************************************

- double quotes inside double quotes are escaped by doubling them
  implement this in man(7) and mdoc(7)
  reminded by millert@  Thu, 09 Dec 2010 17:29:52 -0500

- perl(1) SYNOPSIS looks bad; reported by deraadt@
  1) man(7) seems to need SYNOPSIS .Nm blocks, too

- In .Bl -column,
  .It Em Authentication<tab>Key Length
  ought to render "Key Length" with emphasis, too,
  see OpenBSD iked.conf(5).

- empty phrases in .Bl column produce too few blanks
  try e.g. .Bl -column It Ta Ta

- in enclosures, mandoc sometimes fancies a bogus end of sentence
  reminded by jmc@  Thu, 23 Sep 2010 18:13:39 +0059

************************************************************************
* formatting issues: gratuitious differences
************************************************************************

- .Rv (and probably .Ex) print different text if an `Nm' has been named
  or not (run a manual without `Nm blah' to see this).  I'm not sure
  that this exists in the wild, but it's still an error.

- .%T should be quoted, not underlined, when .%J is also present,
  to better distinguish the contents of .%T and .%J,
  see for example OpenBSD cat(1)

- In .Bl -bullet, the groff bullet is "+\b+\bo\bo", the mandoc bullet
  is just "o\bo".
  see for example OpenBSD ksh(1)

- The characters "|" and "\*(Ba" should never be bold,
  not even in the middle of a word, e.g. ".Cm b\*(Bac" in
  "mknod [-m mode] name b|c major minor"
  in OpenBSD ksh(1)

- A bogus .Pp between two .It must not produce a double blank line,
  see between -R and -r in OpenBSD rm(1), before "update" in mount(8),
  or in DIAGNOSTICS in init(8).
  Also have `It' complain if `Pp' is invoked at certain times (not
  -compact?).

- .Bd -literal and .Bd -unfilled are *not* identical.
  In -literal, tabs are 8 spaces.
  In -unfilled, tabs are 5 spaces, just like in -filled and -ragged.
  See the CCDF_* display in OpenBSD ccdconfig(8).

- .Nx 1.0a
  should be "NetBSD 1.0A", not "NetBSD 1.0a",
  see OpenBSD ccdconfig(8).

- In .Bl -tag, if a tag exceeds the right margin and must be continued
  on the next line, it must be indented by -width, not width+1;
  see "rule block|pass" in OpenBSD ifconfig(8).

- The \& zero-width character counts as output.
  That is, when it is alone on a line between two .Pp,
  we want three blank lines, not two as in mandoc.

- When .Fn arguments exceed one output line, all but the first
  should be indented, see e.g. rpc(3);
  reported by jmc@ on discuss@  Fri, 29 Oct 2010 13:48:33 +0100

- It seems that .TP does not want TWOSPACE after the tag;
  see bashbug(1); reported by naddy@

- Header lines of excessive length:
  Port OpenBSD man_term.c rev. 1.25 to mdoc_term.c
  and document it in mdoc(7) and man(7) COMPATIBILITY
  found while talking to Chris Bennett

************************************************************************
* performance issues
************************************************************************

Several areas can be cleaned up to make mandoc even faster.  These are 

- improve hashing mechanism for macros (quite important: performance)

- improve hashing mechanism for characters (not as important)

- the PDF file is HUGE: this can be reduced by using relative offsets

************************************************************************
* structural issues
************************************************************************

- Find better ways to prevent endless loops
  in roff(7) macro and string expansion.
